<i>Create beautiful block gradients in a few clicks! <a href="https://rkrch.github.io/">Web version available here</a></i></p>

<b>HueBlocks is an online Minecraft block gradients generator powered by jQuery, Python and cinnamon latte. </b>
<br>It's really simple to use: just enter two colours on a gradient bar and press the Big Black Button. That's it!

Additionally you can:<ul>
<li>use custom chain lenght if you want to get bigger or smaller block gradient
<li>pick starting/final colour from the block you want to start/end with
<li>select a blocks preset (or even create your own!) if you want to generate a gradient using only specific blocks
<li>switch between new and old textures (blocksets) if you're playing on legacy Minecraft versions
<li><b>[ʙᴇᴛᴀ]</b> use your own blocksets if you want to create a gradient out of non-Vanilla blocks
<li><i>etc.</i></ul>
